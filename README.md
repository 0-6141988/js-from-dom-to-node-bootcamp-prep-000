# Moving Away from the DOM

Congratulations! You are now able to understand how Javascript interacts with the websites throught the DOM. That's a big deal. Take a few seconds, breathe in, breath out and realize that you now know something you didn't before. Only a few lessons ago, you were didn't even know what the DOM was. Now you understand how to manipulate it.

If you ever want to show your friends something cool, open up the console on any web page and then find the selector for an element, then modify it using
Javascript in the console. Prepare to enjoy the shock and awe of your friends!

## From DOM Manipulation to Programming Logic

The rest of this material, we will be moving from the basics of DOM manipulation to the meat and potatoes of programming. This means we are going to expand on the ideas of conditionals, looping, encapsulation and syntax. I know those may not be 100% familiar to you, but over the next few lessons they will become second hand! Remember when DOM was a scary word? Encapsulation will soon go the way of the DOM and become second nature. You're going to be encapsulating everything.

Really the goal of the rest of this course is to introduce you to _programmatic thinking_. We will be doing that through explaining Javascript, but the goal of every student we serve at The Flatiron School is to teach programmatic thinking as a general way to solve problems. These problems may be creating the next Facebook, or it may be just solving the best order to complete your errands. You'll notice programmatic, logical thinking starting to permeate throughout your decision process. It's incredibly powerful and something that has aided millions of programmers to solve some of the hardest problems in the world. 

That, is the goal with this class. While we may touch on making pictures of cats spin, we want you to internalize the thought process required to solve that silly problem. Hopefully, you'll go off after this class and solve some slightly more important problems :)

### Javascript Outside of the Browser

You've spent some time in the browser with javascript. That's great. Now let's get to where Javascript has been rapidly increasing its programming market share: outside of the browser. You may have heard of it, but a new tool called NodeJS was created a few years back to allow developers to write Javascript code outside of the browser. That is what we are going to use now to be able to go deep on programmatic thinking, without having to explain complicated browser interactions. We want to simplify programming down to its most core elements.
